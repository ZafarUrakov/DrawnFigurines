Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.

Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.
```C#
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) 
{
  // code block to be executed
}
```

**Statement 1** is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

**Statement 2** defines the condition for executing the code block.

**Statement 3** is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.


```C#
Classes
public class Messages{...}

Methods
static void Name(){...}
```
